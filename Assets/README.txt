MECHANIC IMPLENTED: Rope Swing

HOW DOES IT WORK:

It works the same as any other interactable. You walk up to it, and press E to interact with it. Then you push forwards and backwards (W/S) to start swinging. 
If you press E to get off, you just fall to the ground where the rope was. 

But if you press spacebar upon getting off, you will be flung in the direction you were swinging in.

WHAT DYNAMICS AROSE WHEN ADDING THIS MECHANIC:
You are now able to swing using the vine, which makes some gaps easier to cross (if you aren't good with the dash/If it is too far.)

HOW DOES IT FEEL TO INTERACT WITH: 
Pretty smooth all things considered, it is a rope swing after all, you can never go wrong with a rope swing.
I originally wanted it to go where you can jump and grab it, but with the way the grabbing is coded, you cannot, so instead you can just swing with it.
